Udacity Nano-Degree Python project The game of Rock Paper Scissors is played throughout the world. 
It dates back to the Han Dynasty of ancient China, contemporary with the Roman Empire. 
Today it is called jian dao, shi tou, bu in China, pierre-papier-ciseaux or chifoumi in France; roshambo in parts of the U.S., 
taş kağıt makas in Turkey, and jan-ken-pon in Japan. 
It is the distant ancestor of the type system in the immensely popular Pokémongames. 
The game is played competitively; there have been international RPS tournaments — however, 
it's more commonly used as a playful way of settling disputes, whether in the schoolyard or the barroom. 
The game has two players. In a single round of the game, each player secretly chooses one of 
three moves, or "throws" — rock, paper, or scissors. Then, players reveal their moves at the same time. 
If both players picked the same move, there is no winner. 
Otherwise, rock beats scissors; paper beats rock; and scissors beat paper. 
Players can play a single round, or "best of three", or any number of other options
